                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
                <ul><li> 1 Ostrich egg</li>
                    <li>1 Red Bell Pepper Diced</li>
                    <li>3 Spring Onion Diced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup Cheddar Cheese Grated</li>
                    <li>3 knobs Butter</li>
                    <li>6 tbsp Milk</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Fresh Thyme to garnish</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            
            <ol><li>Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together.</li>
                <li>Use the back of a knife to crack the shell of the ostrich egg, being careful with your fingers. Pour the egg into a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add diced red bell pepper, diced spring onion, milk, salt and pepper to the mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Using a whisk, give the mixture a good mix to bring the ingredients together.</li>
                <li>On a low heat, add the knobs of butter to a frying pan until melted.</li>
                <li>Gently pour in the omelette mixture, moving the mixture from the edges in the beginning until it begins to set.</li>
                <li>Once one side has set enough to get leverage underneath with a spatula, flip it over so that it can cook on both sides. It should only take 2 minutes for the mixture to be flippable.</li>
                <li>Add your cheddar cheese on top, spread evenly so that it melts through.</li>
                <li>Cook for a further 2 minutes. Check that it is thoroughly cooked by poking with a knife and ensuring there are no watery bits still lingering in the pan.</li>
                <li>Once it is cooked, flip half of the omelette onto the other half to create a semi-circle and remove from the pan to the plate.</li>
                <li>Season with thyme and additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>
